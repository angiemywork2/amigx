An app that provides health tips, over-the counter medicine information, prescription manangement! This app can be used in Spanish!

This app has access to medication and its instructions and translates instructions into spanish. We feel this is valuable application that could positively affect the growing spanish-speaking population, which is often ignored in the majority of the app market. We feel it addresses an important issue in the medical and spanish-speaking immigrant community, by helping people who donâ€™t speak English as a first language take their medications correctly. This is important, due to the fact that spanish-dominant patients often take medications incorrectly or stop too early due to miscommunication or mistranslations. Thus, with this app we hope to address this niche.
